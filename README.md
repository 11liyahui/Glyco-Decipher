[![Latest release](https://badgen.net/github/release/Naereen/Strapdown.js)](https://github.com/DICP-1809/Glyco-Decipher/releases/)
- Glyco-Decipher is a freely available software tool aimed at interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra of N-glycopeptides fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) in stepped energy mode.


- Glyco-Decipher enables glycan database-independent peptide search for N-glycopeptide mass spectra and provides comprehensive profiling of N-glycans in samples.
Glyco-Decipher can detect new glycans that not present in glycan databases and can elucidate monosaccharide composition of new glycans and potential modifications on them.


- Glyco-Decipher can sensitively and reliably identify thousands of site-specific glycans for glycoproteomics analysis.


- Label-free quantification is achieved in Glyco-Decipher by extracting elution profiles of intact glycopeptides in MS1. And the quantification results are able to map to the glycosites in proteins for biological study.


- Glyco-Decipher is designed for the analysis of intact glycopeptide mass spectrum acquired from stepped collision mode fragmentation and **exhibits best identification performance for mass spectrum acquired at normalized collision energy (NCE) at 20%-30%-40% with long chromatography gradient**.
